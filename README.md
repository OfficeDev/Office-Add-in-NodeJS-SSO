# Office Add-in that that supports Single Sign-on to Office, the Add-in, and Microsoft Graph

The `getAccessToken` API in Office.js enables users who are signed into Office to get access to an AAD-protected add-in and to Microsoft Graph without needing to sign-in again. 

There are three versions of the sample in this repo, one of which has its own README file:

- In the **Begin** folder is the starting point for the SSO walkthrough at at [Create a Node.js Office Add-in that uses single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/create-sso-office-add-ins-nodejs). Please follow the instructions in the article.
- In the **Complete** folder is the completed sample you would have if you completed the walkthrough. To use this version, follow the instructions in the article [Create a Node.js Office Add-in that uses single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/create-sso-office-add-ins-nodejs), but substitute "Complete" for "Begin" in those instructions and skip the sections **Code the client-side** and **Code the server-side**.
- In the **SSOAutoSetup** folder is essentially the same complete sample (with some slight differences in folder structure), but it contains a utility that will automate most of the registration and configuration. Instructions are in the README in that folder. Use this version if you would like to see a working SSO sample right away. However, we recommend that at some point you go through the manual process of registration and configuration that is documented in [Create a Node.js Office Add-in that uses single sign-on](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/create-sso-office-add-ins-nodejs), if you have never registered an app with AAD before. Doing so will give you a better understanding of what AAD does and the significance of the configuration steps.

These samples are built on Node.JS, Express, and Microsoft Authentication Library for JavaScript (msal.js). 

## Features

Integrating data from online service providers increases the value and adoption of your add-ins. This code sample shows you how to connect your add-in to Microsoft Graph. Use this code sample to:

* Build an Add-in using Node.js, Express, msal.js, and Office.js. 
* Connect to Microsoft Graph from an Office Add-in.
* Use the OneDrive REST APIs from Microsoft Graph.
* Use the Express routes and middleware to implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization framework in an add-in.
* See how to use the Single Sign-on (SSO) API.
* See how an add-in can fall back to an interactive sign-in in scenarios where SSO is not available.
* Use the msal.js library to implement a fallback authentication/authorization system that is invoked when Office SSO is not available.
* Show a dialog using the Office UI namespace when Office SSO is not available.
* Use add-in commands in an add-in.


## Applies to

- Excel on Windows (subscription)
- PowerPoint on Windows (subscription)
- Word on Windows (subscription)

## Prerequisites

To run this code sample, the following are required.

* A code editor. We recommend Visual Studio Code which was used to create the sample.
* A Microsoft 365 account which you can get by joining the [Microsoft 365 Developer Program](https://aka.ms/devprogramsignup) that includes a free 1 year subscription to Microsoft 365. During the preview phase, the SSO requires Microsoft 365 (which includes the subscription version of Office). You should use the latest monthly version and build from the Insiders channel. You need to be an Office Insider to get this version. For more information, see [Be an Office Insider](https://products.office.com/office-insider?tab=tab-1). 
    > Note: When a build graduates to the production semi-annual channel, support for preview features, including SSO, is turned off for that build.
* At least a few files and folders stored on OneDrive for Business in your Microsoft 365 subscription.
* A Microsoft Azure Tenant. This add-in requires Azure Active Directory (AD). Azure AD provides identity services that applications use for authentication and authorization. A trial subscription can be acquired here: [Microsoft Azure](https://account.windowsazure.com/SignUp).

## To use the project

Please go to the README in the **Complete** or **SSOAutoSetup** folder for the next steps.

## Security note

These samples send a hardcoded query parameter on the URL for the Microsoft Graph REST API. If you modify this code in a production add-in and any part of query parameter comes from user input, be sure that it is sanitized so that it cannot be used in a Response header injection attack.
